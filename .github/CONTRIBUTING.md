</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>Thank you for considering contributing to this project!</b>
</p>

<br/>

Before you doing so, **please read the following simple steps** on how to contribute. This will **make life easier and help to avoid wasting time** on things, which are not requested. ‚è≥

<br/>

## üìë	Get Familiar With The Project And It's Tools

Check out **in detail** the:

 - **`README.md`**, especially the **Usage** and **API** sections

 - **`package.json`** for **NPM scripts**, additional **configs**, and **dependencies**
 
 - **`src`** directory for **sources**, **structure**, and **naming conventions**

 - **`*.js`** files for **coding style** and **commenting style**, and get familiar with [**StandardJS**][url-code]

 - **`tests`** directory for **tests**, the **test style**, the **test process**, and get familiar with [**Jest**][url-test]

 - **`scripts`** directory and the **project's `root`** for **tools**, **scripts**, **tasks**, **configs**, and get familiar with [**Gulp**][url-task]

 - [**Issues**][url-issues] and [**Commits**][url-commits] for the [**release workflow**][url-release] and get familiar with [**commitizen commit message conventions**][url-commit-style]
  
<br/>

## üí°	Discuss The Change

 - **Search** open and closed issues **first before submitting a new one**. Existing issues often contain ***workarounds, resolutions, or progress updates***.

 - If you **couldn't find** the relevant issue, **open a** [**New Issue**][url-new-issue] by choosing the ***appropriate and relevant issue type***.
 
 - **Follow the guide** of the issue type you chose and **describe your contribution in detail** and what change would you like to make.

 - **Adhere** to the [**Code of Conduct**][url-coc] for a more welcoming environment, productive contribution, and smoother experience.

 - **Wait for feedback before continuing** to the next steps. ***However, if the issue is clear*** *(a tiny bug, a build, or a doc typo, etc)* and ***the fix is simple***, you can ***continue and fix it***.

<br/>

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixing Issues

 - [**Fork**][url-help-fork] **the project**, then:
 
   - **Clone your own fork**:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/duration.git
     ```

   - Navigate into the project's directory, **configure the remote**, then **install the dependencies**:

     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/js-standards/duration.git
     npm install
     ```     

   - If you cloned a while ago, **get the latest changes** from upstream, then **update the dependencies**:

     ```bash
     git checkout master && git pull upstream master
     rm -rf node_modules && npm install
     ``` 
 
 - **Create a new branch** for your change using [**commitizen-style**][url-commit-style] naming convention **in dash-case**:

   - Use **this general template** for your branch names, notice `<scope>` is optional ***(omit ONLY, when you're working on a larger, or multifaceted change with several scopes)***:

     ```bash
     git checkout -b <type>-<scope?>-<subject>
     ```

   - General examples:

     ```bash
     # bugfix:
     git checkout -b fix-scope-short-imperative-tense-title

     # feature:
     git checkout -b feat-scope-short-imperative-tense-title

     # feature without scope (omitted):
     git checkout -b feat-short-imperative-tense-title

     # doc change:
     git checkout -b docs-scope-short-imperative-tense-title
     ```

   - Specific examples:

     ```bash
     # bugfix:
     git checkout -b fix-homepage-fix-hero-typos     

     # feature:
     git checkout -b feat-backend-add-image-resizing

     # feature without scope (omitted):
     git checkout -b feat-add-initial-image-upload

     # test:
     git checkout -b test-validation-add-middle-name-tests
     
     # test without scope (omitted):
     git checkout -b test-add-initial-form-tests
     ```
 
 - **Commit your changes** in that branch **in logical chunks**:
 
   - Make sure to adhere to [**commitizen**][url-commit-style] conventions, **otherwise your code is unlikely to be merged into the main project**. For your own convenience, ***optionally*** you can run this NPM script to help with your commit messages:
   
     ```bash
     npx git-cz
     ```

   - For the **main change** ***(when you're done with your fix/feature/test/etc.)*** use the proper [**commit message format**][url-commit-format]:

     ```
     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <body>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <breaking change>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <footer>
     ```

     - Example:

       ```
       fix(validator): fix middle name validation
 
       Fix the broken middle name validation, when choosing `detailed` name option for first, middle, and last name. Also add a boolean toggle for middle name validaton.
 
       Closes #42
       ```

   - For **intermediate/small changes** ***(when you're not done yet with the particular fix/feature/test/etc., but you need to commit some changes)*** use the shorter, simpler `subject-body` format:

     ```
     <subject>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <body>
     ```

     - Example:

       ```
       add initial dirs and files
  
       Add an initial .gitattributes file with initial, default content.
       Also add lib/ and src/ dirs with .gitkeep files.
       ```

   - **Add yourself** to the [**array of contributors**][url-npm-contrib-doc] *(create it if it doesn't exist)* in **`package.json`**:
   
     ```json   
     "contributors": [
       "Your Name <your@email.com> (www.yoursite.com)"
     ],  
     ```

 - **Ensure consistency and quality** throughout all changes:

   - Follow and adhere to [**StandardJS**][url-code] coding style and make sure the **tests run without errors** by running:

     ```bash
     npm run lint
     npm test
     ```

   - Use Git's [**interactive rebase**][url-rebase] feature to tidy up your commits **before making them public**:

     ```bash
     git rebase --interactive [base]
     ```
   
 - **Then finally**:

   - Locally **merge** ***(or rebase)*** **the upstream branch** into your branch:

     ```bash
     git pull [--rebase] upstream master
     ```

   - **Push your branch** up to **your fork**:

     ```bash
     git push origin <your-branch-name>
     ```

<br/>

## üèÅ Submit A Pull Request

 - Open a [**pull request**][url-pull-req], follow the descriptions, **fill out the sections** accordingly, and **reference the initial issue** [**in the pull request message**][url-pull-req-help] *(e.g.: fixes #42)* - if exists, so everybody will know what is fixed/improved.

 - For **ambitious changes**, open a Pull Request as soon as possible with the `[WIP]` prefix in the title, in order to get feedback and help from the community. 
 
 - **If it makes sense**, add screenshots, gifs, etc., so it will be easier to see what is going on.
 
 - [**Allow the project owners to make changes**][url-pull-req-edit] to **your pull request branch**, so we can rebase it and make some minor changes if necessary *(all changes we make will be done in new commit and we'll ask for your approval before merging them)*.

 - Make sure [**GitHub Actions**][url-ci] runs all tests **without errors** on your **own branch** (*if GitHub Actions errors out on your own branch, fix the issues, then commit and push again until all tests run without errors)*.

 - **IMPORTANT**: by submitting a change, you **agree to allow the project owners** to license your work under the terms of:
 
   - [**ISC License**][url-license-isc] ***(if it includes code changes)***
   - [**CC BY 3.0 License**][url-license-cca-3] ***(if it includes documentation changes)***
   - [**CC BY 4.0 License**][url-license-cca-4] ***(if it includes media, graphical, presentation changes)***

<br/>

## üëç Wait For Feedback

Your **contribution will be reviewed** before accepted. ***You may get feedback*** about what should be changed/fixed in your contribution.
