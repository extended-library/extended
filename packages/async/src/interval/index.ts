// TODO: a smarter setInterval

/*
  - keep track number of execution
  - isFirstTime: boolean - true if this is the first time to execute
  - isLastTime: boolean - true if this will be the last time (number of max execution, max time)
  - cancelable
  - delayable (ability to change interval between calls)
  - set max number of repeats / max number of duration to pass in milliseconds
  - keep track of passed time in milliseconds
  - look for more: https://github.com/polygenx/common
